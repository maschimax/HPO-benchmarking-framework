# HPO benchmarking framework
- Framework for benchmarking Hyperparameter Tuning techniques for Machine Learning use cases in manufacturing
- Integrated HPO libraries: hpbandster, hyperopt, optuna, skopt, robo
- Integrated HPO methods: Random Search, CMA-ES, Hyperband, GPBO, SMAC, TPE, BOHB, Fabolas, Bohamiann
- Integrated ML algorithms: Random Forests, Neural Networks, SVM, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors

- Use Cases:
  - Air pressure system failures in Scania trucks: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/aps-failure-at-scania-trucks-data-set  
  - Kaggle-Challenge: Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
